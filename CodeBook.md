Open "run analysis.R" in R studio, and do follow steps,

#Steps in producing the code and the result in the tidy data set text file #Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
- Reading these files (training tables, testing tables, feature vector, activity labels, variable names, 
- Combine all data into one set
- Extracting mean and standard deviation in each measurement
- Read variable names 
- Create vector to define ID, mean and standard deviation 
- Make subset from combined data
- Use descriptive activity names for activities in data set
- Label data with descriptive variable name
- Create second and independent tidy data set for each activity and subject with its average, then create second tidy data set 
- Save/Write tidy_data set to txt file.
